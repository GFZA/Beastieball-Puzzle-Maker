A web tool for creating images used as Beastieball puzzles, featuring real-time damage previews, saving and loading, and more.
The resulting image size is 2700 x 2025 px (4:3 ratio).

## How to Use
- __Clicking on either left tabs or on the image to start editing.__ The rest should be pretty straightforward.
- __Right clicking on beasties in the image will quickly remove them.__ A pretty useful shortcut.
- __Hovering on damage indicators will show a bigger version of it.__ Helpful if you can't see the small number text.

## Limitations
- __Only supports 4 team members.__ This is due to the limited space of the resulting image, and having 5 members on each side would add too much information for puzzles.
- __Only the first play slot, if it's an attack, shows its damage.__ Again, this is due to limited space, and having multiple attacks might be too much information for puzzles.
- __Benched beasties can’t preview damage to the opposing bench.__ Limited space, you know the drill.
- __The texts are too small.__ The resulting image will have much higher resolution than what's shown in the tool.

## Known Issues
- __Stacking beasties heavily breaks the UI.__ The tool was not designed with stacking in mind. It’s advised to keep each member in their own lane, or hide one of the beastie's play previews if stacking is needed.
- __Having more than two boost types breaks the UI.__ This is intentionally left as is. It’s advised not to have more than two boost types however.
- __Having more than two feelings overshoots the clouds.__ This is intentionally left as is. It’s advised not to have more than three feelings however.
- __The program is slow.__ The cause is currently unknown and is under investigation.
- __Some beasties' poses are unfinished.__ The tool will be updated periodically with each balance patch.
- __NFEs are missing.__ They will get added soon. And yes, Sprecko and Turogue are privileged.
