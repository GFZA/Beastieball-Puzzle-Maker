A web tool for creating images used as Beastieball puzzles, featuring real-time damage previews, saving and loading, and more.
The resulting image size is 2700 x 2025 px (4:3 ratio).

Link to the web: """soon"""

## Limitations
- __Only supports 4 team members.__ This is due to the limited space of the resulting image, and having 5 members on each side would add too much information for puzzles.
- __Benched beasties can’t preview damage to the opposing bench.__ Again, this is due to limited space.

## Known Issues
- __Stacking beasties heavily breaks the UI.__ The tool was not designed with stacking in mind. It’s advised not to stack beasties and to keep each member in their own lane for now.
- __The program is slow.__ The cause is currently unknown and is under investigation.
- __Some beastie poses are unfinished.__ The tool will be updated periodically with each balance patch.
